## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for its tagging. 

The general format:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
