        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>The following is best done with two or more people&mdash;one to feed the pork into the grinder and the other to feed the grinder's output into the casings.</p>

            <li>Crush and chop cranberries and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix all spices together in a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Chop pork into small pieces with knife and place in large bowl. Keep the bowl as cold as possible.</li>
            <li>Feed chopped meat into grinder and collect ground output into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly mix ground meat, cranberries, and spices together in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Attach the sausage filler attachment to the grinder and place a casing on the end.</li>
            <li>Turn on the grinder's motor or begin rotating it by hand if using a manual one.</li>
            <li>Begin feeding the sausage mix into the grinder.</li>
            <li>Every seven inches or so, twist the casing 2&ndash;3 revolutions and tie off with butcher's twine to create a new link.</li>
            <li>Continue until the casing is filled and tie off the end.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 8&ndash;10 as necessary to fill up casings until the pork is gone.</li>
        </ol>
